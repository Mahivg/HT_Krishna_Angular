			Why Angular is so famous?
			
				SPA
				
				Modularized Application Development
				
					AppModule => Rootmodule => main.ts
					
						AppComponent => Root COmponent => AppModule[Bootstrap]
				
					ProductModule
					
						products => components
						
						product-detail
						
					PaymentModule
					
						check-out
						payment
						
				Testing Framework => Karma
				
				It support various UI framework
				
					AngularMaterial
					
					Bootstrap
					
					MaterialBootsrap
					
				
			
			Chrome , firefox, IE, Edge, Safari
			
			polyfills.ts
			
		
		Why Module ?		
		
			Components, Directives, Services (worker class), Pipes (modify ur view output), 	
			
			
			component1
				.css, .ts, .html
			
			
			Inform to modules => 
			
		
		
		Flow
		
		from angular.json
		
			index.html, main.ts
			
							AppModule --> Root Module -> app.module
									AppComponent --> RootComponent
				
			
				Customize it
				
					many components => Child for Rootcomponent
			
			
			
			
			
			Components
					
					Basic block of application
					
						.css, ts, html 
						
						<app-root> </app-root> => render the content present in app.component.html
						
						Creating a custom HTML tag
						
						<h1>, img, div, html
						
					product.component.
										html
						<app-product>
						
						</app-product>
						
						
			Create two project
					
					Bootstrap as out UI Framework
					
					MyFirstApp
					
						We will use this one to learn new concepts
					
					ShoppingCart
						
						We will implement to create a application
						
						
						
			
			Components:
			
				One UI template --> which can be reused with the data we are binding
			
			
				How to create a component
				
					3 files =>
					
						.component
					
					MyFirstComponent => app => my-first => 3 files
						
			
					create a class
					
					annotate it with @Component() from angular/core
					
					Pass a json object(meta-data about component)
					
					@Component({
						selector: 'custom-html-tag',
						template,
						templateUrl,
						styles,
						styleUrls					
						
					})
					
					for a string "hi", '', ``
					
					we went to app.module.ts => and registered our component
					
					Various COmponent selector:
					
					selector: 'app-my-first', //<app-my-first> </app-my-first>,
					
					selector: '.app-my-first', <div class="app-my-first"> </div>
					
					
				Angular/Cli
				
					Command to create a component
					
					ng generate component 'component-name'
					
					ng generate component my-second --skipTests=true => 'app-my-second' => 'ht-my-second'
					
					ng g c my-second --skipTests=true
			
			
				AppComponent
				
						MySecondComponent
						
							MyThirdComponent
			
		Project : ShoppingCart
		
			Navigation Bar => navbar component
		
			Login Page => Login Component
			
				Products => 10 products				=> ProductComponent
				
					Product-Detail => Product-Detail compoent
					
						Checkout -> checkout component
						
			Presentation
			
				Page Flow
			
			Data Integration
			
				Data flows
				
		h2 { color: red; }, .h2 { color: red; }
			
			<h2> Test </h2>, <div class="h2"> Test </div>
			
		
	
	Data Binding:
	
	
		Binding ur values from eithert Controller to View, View to controller or both at a time;
		
		
		One-way Data binding: 
		
			Controller to HTML :
		
				String Interpolation :
				
					Controller : num1 = 10;
				
					In your HTML file : {{ num1 }} or {{ 1 + 1 }}
					
				Property binding:
				
					str1="Some text";
					
					<input id="txt1" name="txtName" class=""  value="" />
					
					<div textContent="" innerHTML="">
					
					In Your HTML elements we need to use : []
					
					Example:
					
						<input type="text" [value]="num1" />
					
			HTML to controller :
			
				Event Binding : 
				
					Data will be passed to controller based on any event:
							
							Interact with your input element 
							
							<button onclick="function()" />
							
							Press any button => click
							
							
							
				In your HTML you have to use : ()
					
						(click)="function()"
						
		
		Gets value from html to controller:
		
			Template Reference:
			
				#
			
				<input id="txtInput" type="text" class="form-control" #myTxt />
				
				myTxt.id => txtInput
				
				<h2>Event Binding</h2>
				
				1. Create a template reference variable ex: #myInput
				
				2. Either pass the variable to controller in any function
				
				3. Or Bind the template reference with @ViewChild('templateRefName') 
					ex: @ViewChild('myInput') txtInput: ElementRef;				
					
		
						
						
					HTML Properties
					
						common properties
						
							id, name, class, style
					
						INPUT => input , button
								value, disbaled => [disbaled]="true | false"
								
						Other =>						
							textContent, innerHTML, 
						
									
					
					
		Directives :

			Will be applied on your component html elements
			
			Attribute Directives
			
			 <input id="num2" type="number" class="form-control" #myNumInput />
			
				<h2 class="mycss" style="font-size: 20px;"> Test </h2>
				
				style, class based on some condition
				
				ngStyle, ngClass
				{
					'key' : value,
					'key1' : value
				}
				
				<h2 [ngStyle]="{ 'font-size' : num2 % 2 == 0 ? '20px' : '25px' }" > Test </h2>
				
				<h2 [ngClass]="{ 'mycss' : num2 % 2 == 0" > Test </h2>
			
			
			Structural Directives
			
				*
			
				Will change ur html element presence
				
				disturb ur html DOM tree
				
				Hide and Show
				
				<div>
					
				</div>
				
				Examples of SD :
				
					ngIf, ngFor
					
					*ngIf="Truthy | falsy value" => Hide and Show
					
					*ngFor = > loop your html elements
					
					
		
		step 1 ) input    => typing 
		step 3 ) userName => update userName and print the userName {{}}
		
		Step 2 ) button1 => click => 
		step 4 ) button2 => [disabled]="if userName is empty"
		
		Step 5)	enable => click => you shoul make userName as empty => clearing the userName
		 			
					
					
				

		ngFor
					
			If you have array of elements, we could able to iterate it in HTML
			
			in javascript :
			
				for(let i = 0; i < 5 ; i++ ) {
					console.log(i); // i => value
				}
				
				let myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
				
				for(let i = 0; i < myArray.length ; i++ ) {
					//i is the index of your array
					console.log(myArray[i]); // myArray[i] is the value
				}
				
			In Angular, HTML
			
				let myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
			
				*ngFor="let i of myArray" 
				
				<div *ngFor="let i of ['str1', 'str2']" >				
					{{ i }}				
				</div>		

				i => is the value
				
				*ngFor="let i of myArray; index as ind; first as firstElem; last as lastElem; odd as oddElem; even as evenElem" 
				
				index => 'child-' + ind => child-0
					
				Result:
				
				<div>
					1
				</div>
				
				<div>
					2
				</div>
					
				<div>
					3
				</div>
				
				<div>
					4
				</div>
				
				<div>
					5
				</div>
					
					
					
					
				Component Interaction:
				
				
					AppComponent
					
						NavbarComponent
							4 buttons
						
					4 buttons
						
						
					Login
					
					Product
					
						product-detail
					
					
					2 Process:	
					Angular provides
					
						@Input, @Output					
						1. Passing Data from Parent to child-
							
							1. Create a value in parent with some variable 
								ex: myStrArray
								
							2. Create a varaible in child and annotate it with @Input
								ex: @Input() myThirdArray
							
							3. In child declaration, in html selector add the property binding
								<app-my-third [myThirdArray]="myStrArray" > </app-my-third>
							
						2. Intreaction from child to parent
					
					
		
		
			Assignment of Directives:

			1. Add a button which says 'Display details'
			
			2. Add a paragraph(<p>) with any content you want 
			
			3. Toggle the displayed content with click of button
			
			4. Log all the button clicks in array and output the array below the paragraph ( May be log button click with timestamp or show counter )
			
			5. Starting with the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background ( via ngStyle ) and white color ( via ngClass )
		
		
		
		
		Event Binding
		
		controller.ts
			
			buttonClicked(event) {
				MouseClicked
					click, hover
			}
		
			(click)="controllerMethod()"
			
			
			(click)="buttonClicked()"
			
			ng-click , ng-mouseover
			
			<button (click)="buttonClicked($event)"> Click </button>
		
		
			
		
			<app-my-third (pushMessage)="receiveMessages($event)"> </app-my-third>
		
		
		
		
		
		Child to Parent
		
		MySecondComponent - @Input
			
			MyThirdComponent
		
				
				
				
							MySecondComponent 
			
			MyThirdComponent(string)		MyFourthChild (number)
		
		
			1. Through event binding
			2. Customly created event
			
			Steps :
			
				1. Create a trigger point in Child or make sure which is ur trigger point
				
				2. Create a event emitter from angular core object in child and annotate it with @Output
				
				3. whenever its get triggered emit the value
				
				4. In parent, create a receiver method
				
				5. Bind the child and parent with event binding syntax
				
					(pushMessage)="receiveMessages($event)"
				
				
		Component Lifecycle:
		
		
			It can be achieved through interface


			ngOnChanges => whenever your @Input values gets changes
			
			ngOnInit
			
			ngDoCheck
			
			ngAfterContentInit
			
			ngAfterContentChecked

			ngAfterViewInit
			
			ngAfterViewChecked
			
			ngOnDestroy
				
				
				
	HTTP Client
	
	
	
	AppComponent => kept data as hardcoded
	
		products
		
		product details
	
	
	Appcomponent not going to have hard coded data
	
	So the data need be feched from a common object
	
	
	
	Services And Dependecy Injection:
	
	
		.ts => 
		
			MyService.ts => class MySevice  { id: number; name: string; }
			
			
			MyService myS1 = new MyService();
			
			myS1.id = 1;
			myS1.name = "name1";
			
			
			MyService myS2 = new MyService();
			
			myS2.id = 2;			
			myS2.name = "name2";
			
			let s1 = myS1.id;
			
			let s2 = myS2.id;
	
	
	
	MyService =. nEed to be common to components we need to request angular
	
		products: 2 products
		
		
		instance = new MyService()	
		

	MySecondComponent				
		myServiceSecond = instance
		
		PushProduct() {} => add a new product to myServiceSecond.products
	
	
	MyThirdComponent				
				
		myServiceThird = instance
		
		
	defaulr behaviour of classes
	
	But In Angular, Services
	
		Angular will do 
		
			new MyService() => one time
		
		and gives same value for components
		
			all components will recieve the same instance => Singleton object


	How it will share same instance across components?
	
		Dependency Injection
		
			=> User not needed to worry about creating an object and sharing to needed place.
			
			=> Framework will do for that.
		
				
				
To make a class to service class:
				
	Create a class
	
	Mention it in providers array , can we done in another way => By Annotating the class with @Injectable()
	
	Request angular for instance
		
		constructor(mention the class){}
		
		
	The state of an service object is same across components(wherever user mentioned in constructor)
	
	
	Service Hierarchy
	
		1) AppModule => same throghout the application
		
				Declarations: [
					AppComponent, MyFirstComponent, MySecondComponent, MyThirdComponent
				],
			
				Prodivers: [ MyService ] or If you annatoted with @Injectable({ providedIn: root })
			
			
		2) Adding in root component
		
			AppComponent => Same instance across the application
			
			providers: [ MyService ]
	
	
		3) component level
	
			MySecondComponent
			
				providers: [ MyService ] => seperate instance
		
				I dont want same instance which is shared by other components like AppComponent, MyFirstComponent
	
	
	
	
	
	Appmodule.ts or annatoted
	
		providers: []
	
	
	MySecondComponent => all of it child will receive the same new instance
	
		providers: [ Myservice]
	
	
	
I am not using it in appcomponent level, i need only at products level
	appmodule or annoterd with Injectable
	
	Products component
	
		providers: [ProductService]
	
		product-detail
		
		product-edit
		
		
	product.service.ts
	
	
	
	Example :
	
		Logging service
		
			array: string[]
			
		AppModule


			AppComponnet
			
				Comopnent
				I am adding string to logService.array
		
		
	
		appmodule -> add LoggingService
		App Component ->
		
			Products-> Add LoggingService				Users -> add LoggingService
			
				product-edit								user-edit
				product-add									user-add
		
		
		
	Service Objects	
	
		1) Data storage fpr hardcoded datas
		
		2) all the data action classes
		
		
		

	Routing:
	  
		Based on URL change we need to show the components we need;
	
	Steps: 
	
	
		1. Create your routes
		
			const appRoutes: Routes = [
									  {
										path: 'myfirst',
										component: MyFirstComponent
									  },
									  {
										path: 'mysecond',
										component: MySecondComponent
									  },
									  {
										path: 'mythird',
										component: MyThirdComponent
									  },
									  {
										path: '',
										redirectTo: 'myfirst',
										pathMatch: 'full'
									  }, 
									  {
									  
										path: "**",
										component: PageNotFound
									  }
									];
									
			default routing;
			
				default component need to be displayed
				
			wild routing: 
				**
				
		
		2. Inform Angular about the routes
			i) We need Angular's RouterModule in our application
			
				 RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)
			
		3. To show only the component based on URL, provide placeholder
		
			<router-outlet></router-outlet>
	
		4. Add triggering point => to change the url =>
		
			<a href="login"> Login </a>
			<a routerLink="login"> Login </a>
		
		
		Programmatic Navigation:
		
			1. We requested router service from angular
			2. we called navigateByUrl method
			
			
		Parametarized routing
		
			in our routes we need to give a placeholeder for our router
			
				'mythird/:name'
				
				MyThirdComponent
				
					name  = 
	
	
	
	products => list of products
	
		products/:id => ProductDetail
		
							id -> fetch the product and show the details
	
	
	
	
	Access data from URL:
		1. Inject ActivatedRoute => mention in constructor
		2. access routerParams
		3. fetch the value of your key ex: id, prodId
		4. use that value for ur projection
